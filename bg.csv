An evaluation has been made of the chronology and spatial context of this data, and it is probable that a majority of detected fires (peaking on 1 January 2008) are directly or indirectly linked to the electoral civil unrest. Please note that this fire data product does not discriminate between normally-occurring fires (e.g. slash and burn agriculture) and those resulting from arson or conflict, and therefore contains a large degree of uncertainty as to the cause. Also note that this fire product has not recorded all active fires for this area because of limited duration / area affected, and because of gaps in collection on 31 December 2007 and 2 January 2008.

Security events have been classified according to the type of weapon used: 1-mortars; 2-rocket propelled grenades (RPG); 3-hand grenades; and 4-small arms. Urban areas with increasing concentrations of security events (""hot spots"") have been highlighted with a color scale increasing from blue to red. This intensity image has also been weighted by the type of weapon used, giving prominence to mortars and RPG-based events. Each point symbol represents a specific event in a given location and time. In those instances when multiple mortar shells fell in a specific area on the same day (e.g. 4 mortars fell at the Airport) a single event point symbol was assigned. The spatial accuracy of most points is within 100m of the true location; however a significant minority of events have large degrees of uncertainly and may be accurate only to within a few kilometers. All security-related information used in this analysis has been acquired exclusively from public media sources. The security events depicted on this map have not been independently verified on the ground nor are they likely representative of all security and humanitarian events in this area. Casualty figures recorded for each security event are also likely to be significant underestimates. All security-related data collection, analysis and map production has been done by UNOSAT to help provide the humanitarian community with a spatial context to the ongoing security events in Mogadishu."

A majority of reported ´Suspicious Approach´ incidents may represent accidental vessel approaches misperceived as a pirate threat. Of special interest is the apparent dramatic reduction of pirate activity in southern Somali waters, and a corresponding increase in activity centered in the Gulf of Aden along the coast of Puntland, the semi-autonomous state of Somalia."

All piracy incident data has been obtained from open media sources, specifically the Piracy Reporting Center (PRC) of the International Maritime Bureau (IMB). Incidents are classified into 3 main types: ´Hijacking´ where pirates have taken control of a ship; ´Attempted Hijacking´ where pirates have deployed weapons &  attempted to board a vessel but failed; ´Suspicious Approach´ where a vessel has followed or chased another ship; Note, a number of reported ´Suspicious Approach´ incidents may represent accidental vessel approaches misperceived as a pirate threat.

These fires were identified by the MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites covering the time period of 9 - 14 June 2010, and represent the detection of thermal anomalies (active fires) within a 1km2 zone. Within each square zone shown on the map below, there could be multiple separate burning objects. Although this satellite data product cannot discriminate between naturally-occurring fires and those resulting from arson or armed conflict, an assessment has been made of the chronology and spatial context of this data and it is highly probable that these detected active fire locations are directly linked to the reported civil unrest within the city of Bazar-Kurgan. Note: it is possible that not all active fires/thermal anomalies have been detected in this area because of intermittent cloud cover, limited fire size, or because the fire(s) were not active at the time of satellite data capture, thus these results could represent minimum estimates. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT at emergencymapping@unosat.org.

This is a quantitative damage summary for the city of Osh based on a detailed analysis of crisis satellite imagery acquired on the morning of 18 June 2010. A total of 1,877 affected buildings were identified within the city of Osh. Of this total, 1,805 buildings were totally destroyed and 72 were severely damaged. A further 73 SOS distress signs and 32 roadblocks were also identified as likely indications of distressed ethnic-Uzbek neighborhoods. As illustrated in the overview map on page 3, a density analysis of the affected building sites indicated there are seven major clusters of destruction located along an approximate east-west axis through the center of the city. Within these spatial clusters there is a pronounced degree of damage type homogeneity of near total building destruction, with sharply defined boundaries between affected and unaffected neighborhoods.
A preliminary assessment of building damage signatures indicates that arson was the probable cause because of the prevalence of destroyed rooftops with visibly intact load-bearing walls, a common signature of fire-related damages; a finding supported by the satellite detection of six  active fire zones within the city at 6:25 UTC (12:25 local time) on 12 and 13 June 2010. 52% of affected buildings identified in the satellite imagery of 18 June also fall within the six active fire zones, suggesting that a majority of the building destruction likely occurred as a result of the detected afternoon fires on 12 and 13 June 2010.
A significant majority of affected buildings are directly accessible from main primary or secondary roads suggesting that the suspected arson attacks were perpetrated by individuals or groups who restricted their movement to these main transport routes. Almost all affected buildings appear to have been residential or situated within residential neighborhoods, however there are a few cases of destroyed or severely damaged industrial warehouses or commercial / government facilities.

A total of 330 affected buildings were identified within the city of Jalal-Abad. Of this total, 291 buildings were totally destroyed and 39 were severely damaged. An additional 28 potentially damaged buildings were identified outside the main damage clusters but were likely the result of normal construction/demolition activities unrelated to the recent conflict. In contrast with the city of Osh, no SOS distress signs or roadblocks were identified within Jalal-Abad. 
As illustrated in the overview map on page three, a density analysis of the affected building sites indicated there is a single major cluster of destruction located along two major intersecting roads within the Kugartskaya Dolina area of the city. This single major cluster contains 69.4% of all identified damages for Jalal-Abad. Two smaller clusters have also been identified in the Khazret-Ayub suburb. Within these three spatial clusters there is a high degree of damage type homogeneity of almost 90% building destruction. The boundaries between affected and unaffected neighborhoods in Jalal-Abad are significantly more diffuse and poorly defined than in Osh.
A preliminary assessment of building damage signatures indicates that arson was the probable cause because of the prevalence of destroyed rooftops with visibly intact load-bearing walls, a common signature of fire-related damages. Although no active fires were detected in Jalal-Abad by satellite sensors (unlike in Osh and Bazar-Kurgan), this was likely the result of local cloud cover and/or the lack of sensor coverage when the fires were active. Because of this lack of corresponding sensor data, it is not possible to identify the probable date of when building damages occurred in Jalal-Abad.
A significant majority of affected buildings are directly accessible from main primary or secondary roads suggesting that the suspected arson attacks were perpetrated by individuals or groups who restricted their movement to these main transport routes. Almost all affected buildings appear to have been residential or situated within residential neighborhoods, however there are a few cases of destroyed or severely damaged industrial warehouses or commercial / government facilities. No damages have been observed to the transportation network (e.g. roads, bridges) or other key infrastructure sites within the city. The airport is likely fully operational and unaffected."

Because of this lack of corresponding sensor data, it is not possible to identify the probable date & time when building damages occurred in Jalal-Abad.
As illustrated in the three overview maps below, a density analysis of the affected building sites indicated that building damages were highly clustered in multiple zones of destruction. Within these spatial clusters there is a pronounced degree of damage type homogeneity of near total building destruction (90-95%), with sharply defined boundaries between affected and unaffected neighborhoods.
A significant majority of affected buildings are directly accessible from main primary or secondary roads suggesting that the suspected arson attacks were perpetrated by individuals or groups who had specific reasons to restrict their movement to these main transport routes. Almost all affected buildings appear to have been residential or situated within residential neighborhoods, however there are a few cases of destroyed or severely damaged industrial warehouses or commercial / government facilities. No damages have been observed to the transportation network (e.g. roads, bridges) or other key infrastructure sites within the city. Although no visible damages to major telecommunication / utility towers were noted, it was not possible to confirm reports of damages to utility lines because of limited satellite sensor resolution. The airports in Osh and Jalal-Abad were unaffected."

ANALYSIS SUMMARY: Flood waters have continued to rapidly advance north-west into Balochistan Province as part of the massive outflow from the Indus River caused by a suspected canal breach on 8-9 August 2010, north of Sukkur barrage, Sindh Province. Between 8 and 18 August, this outflow body of water has advanced over 120km from the original breach line, covering a total of 2,670 km2, likely inundating approximately 530 villages and 13 towns / cities, along with over 533 km of main roads and 57 km of railway lines and the Shahbaz AB airport. The city of Jaccobabad is severely affected, with flood waters nearly surrounding the city; Route N-65 and the railway leading north are flooded, as are additional road and rail links to the east and west, leaving the only open route south, however 15km of route N-65 to Shikarpur is also flooded. Based on a preliminary assessment of the water flow direction over the last two days it appears that Jacobabad is at risk of being completely encircled by flood water, leaving no functional land transport routes for aid or evacuation.

Villages, towns, infrastructure sites as well as the length of roads and railway tracks within the detected flood water extent have been identified and quantified by administrative district (see included table). In Balochistan Province, over 110 villages, 5 towns and 8 health facilities were identified as probably severely affected by the flood waters, the majority completely inundated or surrounded by flood waters without open land evacuation routes. Over 170 km of primary or secondary roads are likely submerged along with 10 km of railway tracks and 5 bridges. In Sindh Province, over 1,120 villages, 28 towns/cities and 34 health facilities were identified as probably severely affected by the flood waters, the majority completely inundated or surrounded by flood waters without open land evacuation routes. Over 950 km of primary or secondary roads are likely submerged along with 120 km of railway tracks and 23 bridges. In addition to the overall expansion of the flood water extent, there are specific locations of rapid flood water outflow to the west which have advanced over 120km from the original suspected canal breach along a canal line north of Sukkur barrage, inundating a total of 2,670 km2 of land. This flood water outflow event continues to advance at a rate of approximately 10-25km per day and represents a significant threat to potentially hundreds of currently unaffected villages along the boundary between Sindh and Balochistan province. The approximate direction and relative size of these flood outflows have been identified. Please note that the numbers of affected locations presented in this map and associated table represent absolute minimum estimates for the area assessed; because of limitations in available settlement and transportation datasets it is certain that the numbers of affected villages, towns and affected infrastructure / transportation lines are significantly underestimated. This analysis is based on satellite data collected by MODIS sensors from 8-18 August, JAXA PALSAR data on 5 August, and Radarsat-2 data on 5 August 2010. Please note that detected water bodies likely reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field.

This map presents a comprehensive overview of the maximum flood water extent across the affected provinces in Pakistan as detected by a constellation of satellite sensors throughout the course of this catastrophic disaster from 28 July to 16 September 2010. Flood waters depicted on the map have been symbolized with two classes, the first and primary class (shown in red), represents the maximum water extent across the affected provinces, as identified with a very high degree of confidence; the second class (shown in orange), represents potential flood waters which were identified with a moderate to low degree of confidence. Inset satellite images over selected locations across the affected region provide detailed examples of the type of damages and other flood related issues that will need to be addressed during the early recovery and reconstruction phases. Further, a spatial analysis conducted with satellite-derived flood data provided a preliminary estimate of the potential number of villages, towns, infrastructure sites as well as the length of roads and railway tracks directly affected by the flooding. These results have been quantified by administrative province (see included table). Across the whole of the flood affected region, it has been estimated that over 7,490 villages, 135 towns/cities and 190 health facilities were identified as potentially directly affected by the flood waters, the majority of villages completely inundated or surrounded by flood waters without open land evacuation routes. Over 5,000 km of primary or secondary roads were likely submerged along with 400 km of railway tracks and 400 bridges. Please note that the numbers of affected locations presented in this map and associated table likely represent absolute minimum estimates for the area assessed; because of limitations in available settlement and transportation datasets it is certain that the numbers of affected villages, towns and affected infrastructure / transportation lines are significantly underestimated. This disaster analysis was conducted with satellite imagery provided through the International Space Charter as well as from ESA, NASA and USGS.
CALCULATING THE MAXIMUM FLOOD EXTENT 
The estimated total surface area of all satellite-detected flood waters during this event was 37,280km2 based on cumulative analysis from 28 July to 16 September 2010. This estimate includes both water classes shown in the map and has been controlled for the normal, pre-crisis water extent of major rivers, lakes and reservoir water bodies using the best available hydrological datasets. Because of the limited duration of the reported flash floods in the northern provinces of Pakistan (especially Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), as well as limitations of the satellite sensors used for this analysis, it is likely that the total extent of flood waters have been underestimated by potentially upwards of several hundred square kilometres. Nevertheless, the total impact of this probable underestimation is essentially negligible when calculating the overall accuracy and completeness of the flood water."

Significant areas of recent tree cover removal, river dredging and new river channel creation were identified as occurring during the period from August to December 2010 between the San Juan River and Laguna Los Portillos; further there is apparently an area of active land removal on a meander bend of the San Juan River approximately 400m to the south of the newly created channel. If this meander land removal continues, it could redirect the flow of San Juan approximately 175m to the west, likely increasing river flow velocity downstream; such an increase in water velocity could also have the effect of accelerating erosion along the newly created river channel to the north. This preliminary analysis is based on a historic collection of low, medium and very high resolution satellite images recorded between 1979 and December 2010 and has not yet been validated in the field."

ANALYSIS BACKGROUND: This is a satellite based qualitative analysis map series showing new structures and infrastructure developments in Abyei, Sudan, occurring between 22 June 2008 and 23 January 2011. During this period significant numbers of people returned to the Abyei area from which they were displaced by civil war and its aftermath. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 26,270 people had returned to the Abyei area since October 2010. These influxes have resulted in significant development and at the same time have stressed humanitarian relief operations.
Notably, the analysis period follows a brief but intense episode of conflict occurring in May, 2008. At that time, soldiers of the Sudanese Army and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, and militias allied with both sides, caused significant destruction to the town following intense fighting. Up to 90% of the housing was destroyed at that time and many shops and facilities looted, according to sources quoted by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Analysis of Abyei by UNOSAT using a pre-conflict imagery indicates a strong recovery from this violence as well as significant expansion from its pre-conflict size.
Infrastructure Changes
Abyei saw significant development to infrastructure within the time period from 22 June 2008 and 23 January 2011 as the town increased in size, facilities expanded, roads multiplied in number and were often paved, and water availability was enhanced. A rapid UNOSAT mapping exercise documented almost 2 millions square metres of significant development within 21 areas of new buildings and expanded compounds, more than 32 kilometres of new roads including 17 new or significantly expanded unpaved roads as well as 5 newly paved road segments, 15 water reservoirs, and one new water canal."

For this analysis four very high resolution images were available, including GeoEye-1 images from the 10 July & 30 September 2010 and 15 January 2011 as well as a most recent WorldView 2 image from the 26 January 2011. During this period two significant observations were made: firstly the development of building structures between the lake and the village and secondly the construction of a larger road.
The focus maps 1 and 2 show areas of building structures which appeared between the 30 September 2010 and 15 January 2011. Approximately 260 new building structures/tents showed up. They are located 200m south of the lake and divided into two sections with a separation of approximately 300m. Each section shows a more or less ordered structure of buildings, which differs greatly from other village areas. Also the density of buildings is high and not comparable to other parts of the village. It is noteworthy that these buildings are not encircled by a fence or within a compound. 
A count of already existing buildings (buildings that were visible between the 10 July 2010 and 26 January 2011) in the area resulted in about 890 permanent buildings. Therefore an increase of 260 new buildings is a significant change for this village.
The second developmentis the road that connects to the mentioned village to the North. This development occurred between the 15 and 26 January 2011. Within this relatively short time span of 11 days an approximately 9,500m long road segment was constructed. However, this figure is only valid for the analyzed extent for which an image was available. The road bypasses Lake Abiad and is for most sections relatively straight additionally the width is between 12 and 20m which indicates the construction of a primary road."

2. Initial ash flow detected on 4 June 2011 with first distinct Thermal signatures detected on morning of 5 June 2011
3. 3D Topographic review of border terrain strongly suggests no direct threat of volcanic induced lahars event from CordónCaullefissure (or PuyehueCaldera) within Argentina, due to distinct watershed boundary along Andes
4. Ash cloud drift direction has ranged within a broad 150 degree cone almost entirely over Argentinean territory, however the majority of measured ash clouds were drifting within a smaller cone east-southeast (between 90-140 degrees) with a secondary cone north-northeast (350-90 degrees)
5. The zone of heaviest ash deposition appears within imagery to be within a zone approximately 10,000km2 in area, ranging up to 110km from the volcanic fissure
6. There were clearly visible ash deposits on Argentinean lake surfaces within 110km of the volcano on 11 June 2011
* Almost the entire surface of LagoA. Gallardo was covered in ash (12km2)

In 2010, UNOSAT produced an internal UN report on Somali pirate attacks based on a detailed geospatial study of available data between 2005 and 2009. This limited distribution report was conducted in support of on-going humanitarian operations in the Horn of Africa. As part of UNOSATs expanding geospatial research on human security challenges, this report produced in 2010 has now been released for public distribution.
Main Analysis Findings:
1) ´The Piracy Big Bang´ : Somali piracy underwent a qualitative transformation between 2007 and 2008 following strategic changes in their rules of engagement and the early development of an operational blue water naval capacity in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean;  
2)	The standard indicators commonly cited as evidence of growing international naval pressure on piracy (1. falling hijacking rates and 2. the growth of piracy in the Indian Ocean) are more complex than originally thought and less convincing as primary barometers for measuring the success of international counter-piracy efforts.
3)	The observed drop in hijacking success rates must be qualified by a potential statistical bias resulting from changes in attack reporting over time, and may reflect a naturally occurring decline resulting from more aggressive pirate rules of engagement and a large influx of untrained pirate recruits. Further, a detailed spatial and temporal analysis of piracy in the Indian Ocean strongly suggests that pirate militias originally viewed their move into deep ocean waters as part of a larger expansion strategy, predating major naval patrols in the Gulf of Aden.

In the map, by mid-August flood waters were restricted to Northern provinces, symbolized in yellow. By mid-September, the flood waters rapidly expanded southward, symbolized in orange; by mid-October, flood waters had expanded dramatically in total area, effectively surrounding downtown Bangkok, while severely affecting most outlining populated areas; As of 14 November 2011, flood waters have further risen into the central portions of the city, while receding very little in the north of the country, indicating that it will likely take several more weeks before an appreciable decline in standing flood waters is observed. A more detailed review of very high resolution satellite imagery over Bangkok indicated that virtually all agricultural fields, significant stretches of major roads and highways as well as large residential areas remain inundated, leaving tens of thousands of residential homes and commercial businesses either partially or totally submerged.

UNOSAT reviewed the town for indicators of damage and destruction resulting from violence reportedly occurring on and around 30 April 2013. Results indicate several areas of destruction where multiple structures were apparently burned (see Figures 1 and 2). A total of 44 structures were definitively identified as destroyed by fire in the Oakka area. Dozens of additional structures are likewise probably burned but cloud cover, high incidence angle of image collection, and presence of vegetation renders their status uncertain. In addition, one possible IDP area was identified in the satellite imagery. The locations of these features are detailed in Map 1. Multiple areas of the image were obscured by clouds and were thus not analyzed."

The White Nile river is clearly at or near peak flow, with a bridge construction project partially submerged (see Figure 1) as well as proximate docks for boats along the river likewise underwater (see Figure 2). In addition, nearby agricultural fields along the White Nile are clearly submerged (see Figure 3).

MODIS Aqua data acquired on 21 October 2012 and MODIS Terra data acquired on 10 October 2011 was also analyzed to allow comparison with seasonal flooding seen in 2011 and 2012. Standing waters seen on the 11 October 2013 appear to cover a slightly larger area than standing water seen on 11 October 2011 and the 21 October 2012. However it is unknown whether the water detected in these images was increasing, peaking, or receding. Water detected in the 2011 and 2012 image may show the waters as they were receding. Both the 2011 and 2013 images were affected by clouds along the coast, to the north, and to the east of the area of interest. Notes: The exact limit of flood waters is uncertain because of the low spatial resolution of the satellite data used for this analysis. Only waters with an area of at least 250 square meters were likely detected in this analysis and thus many smaller water bodies were not visible. Detected water bodies therefore reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated in highly vegetated areas. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT"

An estimated 3,840 damaged structures are visible across 50 distinct locations in the sub-prefecture. Destruction in many cases was likely due to arson based on appearance of structural remains. In addition, it appears violence and destruction continued between 21 June and 7 July, and heavy rains apparently caused significant damage to structures as well.

August 2014 conflict in the area. Using a satellite image collected 14 August 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT performed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index analysis, multitemporal classification, and manual review in order to detect significant changes occurring in agricultural areas between those dates. This methodology assessed damage occurring as a result of razing, heavy vehicle tracking, bombing, shelling, and related conflict dynamics. The analysis includes damage occurring to both active crop fields and fallow lands, as well as in many household gardens. Note that due to the special characteristics of the area analysed, razing might have been overestimated in sandy areas, and some ambiguity often exists between unused lands, pasture lands, agricultural fields, and other land cover types. UNOSAT analysis indicates that ~1,800 hectares of agricultural fields have likely been razed or heavily damaged by these factors in the intervening period. In addition, using imagery acquired on 27 and 28 August 2014 UNOSAT assessed damage to greenhouses and identified a total 657 destroyed, 214 severely damaged and 392 moderately damaged greenhouse structures.

Satellite measurements of land surface temperature (LST) should NOT be confused with tipical weather reports of local air temperature experienced at ground level. Although LST and ambient air temperature are directly related, there can often be a difference of many degrees, and thus is provided here only as an approximate reference to temperatures experienced on the ground in the earthquake-affected region."
