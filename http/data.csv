MODIS Aqua data acquired on 21 October 2012 and MODIS Terra data acquired on 10 October 2011 was also analyzed to allow comparison with seasonal flooding seen in 2011 and 2012. Standing waters seen on the 11 October 2013 appear to cover a slightly larger area than standing water seen on 11 October 2011 and the 21 October 2012. However it is unknown whether the water detected in these images was increasing, peaking, or receding. Water detected in the 2011 and 2012 image may show the waters as they were receding. Both the 2011 and 2013 images were affected by clouds along the coast, to the north, and to the east of the area of interest. Notes: The exact limit of flood waters is uncertain because of the low spatial resolution of the satellite data used for this analysis. Only waters with an area of at least 250 square meters were likely detected in this analysis and thus many smaller water bodies were not visible. Detected water bodies therefore reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent.
