Using a satellite image from 15 March 2012 a Primary Blast Zone with a diameter of 1.5 kilometers around the munitions storage facility was analyzed. Within this zone 1,558 buildings unobscured by clouds were examined, of which 62% were clearly identified as destroyed, 9% had severe damage visible, and 29% indicated no damage visible in the imagery. Cloudy conditions resulted in a total of 966 buildings being obscured, many of which are likely to destroyed or severely damaged. Additionally, a total of 152 destroyed or damaged buildings are visible around the periphery of the Primary Blast Zone. This map also includes the designated No-Go zone in the blast area.
