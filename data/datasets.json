      "notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of standing flood waters and flood affected land over the districts of Satkhira, Khulna, and Jessore, in Khulna Division, Bangladesh, extracted from MODIS Terra data acquired on 11 October 2013. MODIS Aqua data acquired on 21 October 2012 and MODIS Terra data acquired on 10 October 2011 was also analyzed to allow comparison with seasonal flooding seen in 2011 and 2012. Standing waters seen on the 11 October 2013 appear to cover a slightly larger area than standing water seen on 11 October 2011 and the 21 October 2012. However it is unknown whether the water detected in these images was increasing, peaking, or receding. Water detected in the 2011 and 2012 image may show the waters as they were receding. Both the 2011 and 2013 images were affected by clouds along the coast, to the north, and to the east of the area of interest. Notes: The exact limit of flood waters is uncertain because of the low spatial resolution of the satellite data used for this analysis. Only waters with an area of at least 250 square meters were likely detected in this analysis and thus many smaller water bodies were not visible. Detected water bodies therefore reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated in highly vegetated areas. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field.

The 23 November 2014 eruption, the first since 1995, occurred through a subsidiary vent located in the western flank of the Pico de Fogo mountain. The main cone seems to be not involved in the eruption as of the 24 November 2014 image acquisition. About 5,700 meters of roadways in the caldera area seem to be affected by the lava flow and are potentially out of use including the road from the Caldera to Sao Felipe city. The inset of this map illustrates the lava flow and smoke as seen with false colours as captured by Landsat-8 image. Note that the lava flow is likely underestimated because of smoke. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT.\n",

Using satellite images acquired 21 June, 23 June & 7 July 2014, UNOSAT reviewed almost 4,500 square kilometers of Marcounda to locate signs of destroyed structures. An estimated 3,840 damaged structures are visible across 50 distinct locations in the sub-prefecture. Destruction in many cases was likely due to arson based on appearance of structural remains. In addition, it appears violence and destruction continued between 21 June and 7 July, and heavy rains apparently caused significant damage to structures as well. Overall, UNOSAT estimates that approximately 40% of structures in Marcounda Sub-Prefecture have been completely destroyed and many others are likely damaged to some degree. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT.",

Specifically, a total of 337 kilometers of roads in the city were likely mud affected as of 1 September, though this is likely an underestimate given the difficulties assessing road conditions in satellite imagery. In addition, 277 areas of standing water were identified, 19 areas indicated possible flash flood damage, and more than seven square kilometers of river banks, islands, and marshes were flooded.

There has been a dramatic increase of flood waters from the 23rd to 24th January 2013. Multiple villages and the city of Chokwe are inundated by flood waters  along the river. Flood waters have begun streaming south of Chokwe city into surrounding agricultural areas and towns,with similar conditions on the eastern bank of the Limpopo River in the analysis area. Large sections of road and railroad are also potentially affected. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated in highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas due to the characteristics of the satellite data used.

A bridge in the Chinatown neighbourhood appears to be totally destroyed, however the main bridge further north seems intact.

This indicates an approximate 2.5% decrease in the number of shelters between 06 July 2014 and 11 November 2014.

New expansion areas are also visible in the image as of 21 July 2013, indicating preparations are underway to accommodate increased numbers of refugees in the near future.

      "notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Al Zaatari refugee camp in Mafraq Governorate, Jordan. As of 3 January 2013 a total of 11,966 shelters were detected as well as 866 infrastructure and support buildings within the 314 hectares of the camp. The number of shelters has thus increased by about 6,803 since the previous UNITAR/UNOSAT assessment of the camp which used a satellite image from 15 November 2012, indicating the number of camp inhabitants have almost doubled since that date. In addition areas of expansion are also visible in the image as of 3 January 2013, indicating preparations are underway to accommodate similarly increased numbers of refugees in the near future.",
