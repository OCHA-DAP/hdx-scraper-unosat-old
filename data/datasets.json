Paved and unpaved roads have likewise increased significantly and define the transportation network in and around the camp.

A bridge in the Chinatown neighbourhood appears to be totally destroyed, however the main bridge further north seems intact.

Using satellite images acquired 21 June, 23 June & 7 July 2014, UNOSAT reviewed almost 4,500 square kilometers of Marcounda to locate signs of destroyed structures. An estimated 3,840 damaged structures are visible across 50 distinct locations in the sub-prefecture. Destruction in many cases was likely due to arson based on appearance of structural remains. In addition, it appears violence and destruction continued between 21 June and 7 July, and heavy rains apparently caused significant damage to structures as well. Overall, UNOSAT estimates that approximately 40% of structures in Marcounda Sub-Prefecture have been completely destroyed and many others are likely damaged to some degree.

Using a satellite image from 15 March 2012 a Primary Blast Zone with a diameter of 1.5 kilometers around the munitions storage facility was analyzed. Within this zone 1,558 buildings unobscured by clouds were examined, of which 62% were clearly identified as destroyed, 9% had severe damage visible, and 29% indicated no damage visible in the imagery. Cloudy conditions resulted in a total of 966 buildings being obscured, many of which are likely to destroyed or severely damaged. Additionally, a total of 152 destroyed or damaged buildings are visible around the periphery of the Primary Blast Zone. This map also includes the designated No-Go zone in the blast area. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT.",

Using a satellite image collected 14 August 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT performed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index analysis, multitemporal classification, and manual review in order to detect significant changes occurring in agricultural areas between those dates. This methodology assessed damage occurring as a result of razing, heavy vehicle tracking, bombing, shelling, and related conflict dynamics. The analysis includes damage occurring to both active crop fields and fallow lands, as well as in many household gardens. Note that due to the special characteristics of the area analysed, razing might have been overestimated in sandy areas, and some ambiguity often exists between unused lands, pasture lands, agricultural fields, and other land cover types. UNOSAT analysis indicates that ~1,800 hectares of agricultural fields have likely been razed or heavily damaged by these factors in the intervening period. In addition, using imagery acquired on 27 and 28 August 2014 UNOSAT assessed damage to greenhouses and identified a total 657 destroyed, 214 severely damaged and 392 moderately damaged greenhouse structures. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT.",

A total of 1,234 destroyed structures were located in the area, though structures marked as destroyed on 5 December are classed as \"probable\" due to the lack of a previous image for comparison. Some of the destruction detected in the 28 February 2014 image was likely a result of burning given the blackened structural remains visible in the imagery.

This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT.",

Note that IDP occupied areas include improvised shelters and, in some cases, administrative support and other structures.

Using satellite images acquired on the 28 December 2013 by the QuickBird satellite, UNOSAT reviewed the airport grounds and delineated 22.3 ha of area where IDPs are living in shelters and in the open. Imagery acquired on 20 January 2014 shows that the IDP camp extent has increased compared with the previous UNOSAT analysis. The total area of IDPs occupies 26.8 ha as of 20 January 2014, although imagery shows areas where terrain has been cleared and shelters have been relocated. Note that IDP occupied areas include improvised shelters and, in some cases, administrative support and other structures. An area of expansion is also visible in the image as of 20 January 2014, indicating preparations are underway to accommodate increased numbers of refugees in the near future. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT.",

However, about 26 new camps opened in the area and are located primarily on the outskirts of Kismayo. Total IDP camp area is 31.38 ha as of 5 March 2014, versus 29.02 ha as of 11 August 2013.

In addition, areas of IDPs, relief operations, and water pooling due to the landslide are indicated as of 5 May. The 5 May 2014 image was compared to an image from 7 June 2013 in an attempt to determine how many structures were buried, and a total of 87 such structures were located. However, between 7 June 2013 and the occurrence of the landslide Ab Barek had changed and grown considerably, and thus its possible additional buried structures exist which are not identified in this analysis.

The main cone seems to be not involved in the eruption as of the 24 November 2014 image acquisition. About 5,700 meters of roadways in the caldera area seem to be affected by the lava flow and are potentially out of use including the road from the Caldera to Sao Felipe city. The inset of this map illustrates the lava flow and smoke as seen with false colours as captured by Landsat-8 image. Note that the lava flow is likely underestimated because of smoke.

      "notes": "This map illustrates areas affected by Pico de Fogo volcano as seen in a WorldView-2 image acquired 25 November 2014 and LANDSAT-8 data acquired the 24 of November. The lava flow is continuing from the subsidiary vent located in the western flank of the Pico de Fogo Mountain and magma and the lava reached the areas close to Portela, Cha Das Caldeiras and Bangaeira villages. About 3400 meters of the main road and 4600 m of secondary roads and paths in the caldera are affected and are potentially out of use (i.e. 8000 m of roadways potentially affected). The inset of this map illustrates the incandescent lava and smoke as seen with false colors as captured by WorldView-2 satellite. ~150 ha of lava could be observed on the 24 November 2014 and ~260 ha the on 25 November 2014. Note that the lava flow is likely underestimated because of smoke especially in the areas close to the vent. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field.

Specifically, a total of 337 kilometers of roads in the city were likely mud affected as of 1 September, though this is likely an underestimate given the difficulties assessing road conditions in satellite imagery. In addition, 277 areas of standing water were identified, 19 areas indicated possible flash flood damage, and more than seven square kilometers of river banks, islands, and marshes were flooded.

      "notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of standing flood waters and flood affected land over the districts of Satkhira, Khulna, and Jessore, in Khulna Division, Bangladesh, extracted from MODIS Terra data acquired on 11 October 2013. MODIS Aqua data acquired on 21 October 2012 and MODIS Terra data acquired on 10 October 2011 was also analyzed to allow comparison with seasonal flooding seen in 2011 and 2012. Standing waters seen on the 11 October 2013 appear to cover a slightly larger area than standing water seen on 11 October 2011 and the 21 October 2012. However it is unknown whether the water detected in these images was increasing, peaking, or receding. Water detected in the 2011 and 2012 image may show the waters as they were receding. Both the 2011 and 2013 images were affected by clouds along the coast, to the north, and to the east of the area of interest. Notes: The exact limit of flood waters is uncertain because of the low spatial resolution of the satellite data used for this analysis. Only waters with an area of at least 250 square meters were likely detected in this analysis and thus many smaller water bodies were not visible. Detected water bodies therefore reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated in highly vegetated areas. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field.
