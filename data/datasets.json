"notes": "Summary: A total of 324 spatially distinct IDP shelter concentrations were identified as of 24 November 2013 within Mogadishu, representing a decrease of 56 IDP sites since the last UNOSAT analysis which used an image from 13 June 2013. An estimate of the total number of IDP structures located in Mogadishu indicates a minimum figure of at least 55,000 mostly informal shelters. The number of IDP camps has significantly reduced in multiple areas of Mogadishu. This report is the sixth in a series of IDP analyses done by UNOSAT since 2011 and is based on a time-series analysis of shelter concentrations within the city of Mogadishu using multiple satellite images acquired between 30 March 2011 and 24 November 2013. This assessment has not yet been validated in the field. Please send feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT.",
"caveats": "This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters.

For flood extractions, landcover mapping and similar analyses, a variety of automated remote sensing techniques are used to extract the relevant information which is then reviewed and revised as necessary by the analyst.

As of 7 January 2014 a total of 28,093 shelters were detected as well as 1,735 infrastructure and support buildings within the 531.8 hectares of the camp. Between 30 September 2013 and 7 January 2014, a total of 4,982 shelters closed or were moved, and a total of 6,868 shelters were constructed, and the number of shelters has thus increased by about 2,171 since the previous UNITAR/UNOSAT assessment. This indicates an approximate 8.4% increase in the number of shelters between 30 September 2013 and 7 January 2014. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field; structure locations subject to a spatial error margin of +/- three meters. Shelters grouped under plastic sheeting were estimated by average household size and may be a source of error. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT.",

"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of landslide damage in the village of Ab Barek, Badakshan, Afghanistan. Following heavy rains in the region, a landslide partially buried Ab Barek on 2 May 2014. Using a satellite image acquired 5 May 2014 by the WorldView-2 satellite, UNOSAT delineated the landslide area. In addition, areas of IDPs, relief operations, and water pooling due to the landslide are indicated as of 5 May. The 5 May 2014 image was compared to an image from 7 June 2013 in an attempt to determine how many structures were buried, and a total of 87 such structures were located. However, between 7 June 2013 and the occurrence of the landslide Ab Barek had changed and grown considerably, and thus its possible additional buried structures exist which are not identified in this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT.",
"caveats": "This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters.

In addition, it appears violence and destruction continued between 21 June and 7 July, and heavy rains apparently caused significant damage to structures as well.

Using a satellite image collected 14 August 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT performed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index analysis, multitemporal classification, and manual review in order to detect significant changes occurring in agricultural areas between those dates. This methodology assessed damage occurring as a result of razing, heavy vehicle tracking, bombing, shelling, and related conflict dynamics. The analysis includes damage occurring to both active crop fields and fallow lands, as well as in many household gardens. Note that due to the special characteristics of the area analysed, razing might have been overestimated in sandy areas, and some ambiguity often exists between unused lands, pasture lands, agricultural fields, and other land cover types. UNOSAT analysis indicates that ~1,800 hectares of agricultural fields have likely been razed or heavily damaged by these factors in the intervening period. In addition, using imagery acquired on 27 and 28 August 2014 UNOSAT assessed damage to greenhouses and identified a total 657 destroyed, 214 severely damaged and 392 moderately damaged greenhouse structures. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT.",

"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at Minkaman IDP Site in Lakes State, South Sudan, as seen by the WorldView-2 satellite on 24 November 2014. People displaced by ongoing instability in the region of Bor have established multiple IDP camps on the west bank of the White Nile in Awerial County. Imagery acquired on 1 September 2014 showed approximately 16,364 shelters and 670 infrastructure or support buildings occupying multiple areas along the White Nile. Imagery also showed an area being prepared for accommodating new shelters. As of 24 November 2014 this ground has been partially covered by shelters as well as other areas of the IDP site, and approximately 18,636 shelters and 640 infrastructure or support buildings have been detected. Note that IDPs sheltering under trees are not detected by this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT\n",

A total of 4 medical facilities were identified within 100 meters of damaged and destroyed buildings, and it is possible that these facilities also sustained some damage. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT.",

"notes": "This map illustrates topographic features in the planned Kalobeyei site, Turkana County, Kenya using a Digital Elevation Model derived from imagery with 1m resolution. UNITAR-UNOSAT built water levels scenarios that represents the potentially affected areas along the modelled stream network assuming a static raising of waters of 1 meter, 2 meters and 3 meters. Streamlines and static water levels has been extracted from a Hydrologically Conditioned version of the DEM derived from WorldView-2 Imagery with 5 m resolution. The model shows spatial distribution of potential water levels in the basin based on the elevation extracted from the DEM but does not represent a current flood scenario. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT.",
"caveats": "This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org to seek clarification.",

"methodology_other": "UNOSAT datasets and maps are produced using a variety of methods. In general, analysts closely review satellite imagery, often comparing two or more images together, and determine notable changes between the images. For damage assessments, refugee or IDP assessments, and similar analyses, these changes are then manually documented in the vector data by the analyst. For flood extractions, landcover mapping and similar analyses, a variety of automated remote sensing techniques are used to extract the relevant information which is then reviewed and revised as necessary by the analyst. In all cases, resulting data is then loaded into a standardized UNOSAT geodatabase and exported asshapefiles for dissemination.",

"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of destruction in the majority of Taiz, Yemen, as seen by the WorldView-3 satellite on 26 June 2015. UNOSAT identified a total of 328 damaged buildings (54 destroyed, 66 severely damaged, 156 moderately damaged, 52 possibly damaged) as well as 410 areas with significant amounts of debris. A total of 11 health centers are possibly damaged as they are within 100 meters of other destroyed or damaged buildings. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Note that satellite imagery analysis will not capture all damage to buildings and instead only detects significant or catastrophic amounts of structural damage.

Heavy rains at the onset of the monsoon season has caused limited flooding, and flood waters seem to have affected roughly 900 hectares of land within the 425 square kilometer analyzed area. The most affected lands seem to be mainly agricultural and/or paddy fields, many of which are of course frequently inundated at other times as well.  This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field.
