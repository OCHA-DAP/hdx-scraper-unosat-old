Standing waters seen on the 11 October 2013 appear to cover a slightly larger area than standing water seen on 11 October 2011 and the 21 October 2012. However it is unknown whether the water detected in these images was increasing, peaking, or receding. Water detected in the 2011 and 2012 image may show the waters as they were receding. Both the 2011 and 2013 images were affected by clouds along the coast, to the north, and to the east of the area of interest. Notes: The exact limit of flood waters is uncertain because of the low spatial resolution of the satellite data used for this analysis. Only waters with an area of at least 250 square meters were likely detected in this analysis and thus many smaller water bodies were not visible. Detected water bodies therefore reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated in highly vegetated areas. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field.

Using a satellite image collected 14 August 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT performed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index analysis, multitemporal classification, and manual review in order to detect significant changes occurring in agricultural areas between those dates. This methodology assessed damage occurring as a result of razing, heavy vehicle tracking, bombing, shelling, and related conflict dynamics. The analysis includes damage occurring to both active crop fields and fallow lands, as well as in many household gardens. Note that due to the special characteristics of the area analysed, razing might have been overestimated in sandy areas, and some ambiguity often exists between unused lands, pasture lands, agricultural fields, and other land cover types. UNOSAT analysis indicates that ~1,800 hectares of agricultural fields have likely been razed or heavily damaged by these factors in the intervening period. In addition, using imagery acquired on 27 and 28 August 2014 UNOSAT assessed damage to greenhouses and identified a total 657 destroyed, 214 severely damaged and 392 moderately damaged greenhouse structures.

In this area, UNOSAT located 1,781 shelters (391 transitional housing and 1,390 improvised shelters) in 27 apparent IDP settlements. Previous analysis using an image from 12 December 2012 located 1,034 shelters in 10 settlements. The updated analysis therefore shows an increase in IDP shelters of 72%, and new IDP settlements are mainly located on the periphery of the town. Note that some areas of the image were obscured by cloud cover and thus not analyzed. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field.

Areas of expansion are also visible in the image as of 26 February 2013, indicating preparations are underway to accommodate increased numbers of refugees in the near future.","ZIP"

The flooded area above the dam has decreased slightly since the previous analysis using an image from 11 February 2014 and currently encompasses about 2,278 ha. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used.
