This methodology assessed damage occurring as a result of razing, heavy vehicle tracking, bombing, shelling, and related conflict dynamics. The analysis includes damage occurring to both active crop fields and fallow lands, as well as in many household gardens. Note that due to the special characteristics of the area analysed, razing might have been overestimated in sandy areas, and some ambiguity often exists between unused lands, pasture lands, agricultural fields, and other land cover types. UNOSAT analysis indicates that ~1,800 hectares of agricultural fields have likely been razed or heavily damaged by these factors in the intervening period.
