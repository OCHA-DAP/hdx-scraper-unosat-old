      "notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of landslide damage in the village of Ab Barek, Badakshan, Afghanistan. Following heavy rains in the region, a landslide partially buried Ab Barek on 2 May 2014. Using a satellite image acquired 5 May 2014 by the WorldView-2 satellite, UNOSAT delineated the landslide area. In addition, areas of IDPs, relief operations, and water pooling due to the landslide are indicated as of 5 May. The 5 May 2014 image was compared to an image from 7 June 2013 in an attempt to determine how many structures were buried, and a total of 87 such structures were located. However, between 7 June 2013 and the occurrence of the landslide Ab Barek had changed and grown considerably, and thus its possible additional buried structures exist which are not identified in this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT.",

Starting in June 2012 numerous wildfires have burned pine and oak forests within northern Algeria, likely resulting from a heat wave. The wildfire burn scars cover and approximate area of 1,524 square km. Subset one details satellite detected fire scars south of Blinda city and north of Medea city. Subset two details fire scars detected north of Setif city. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT.",

      "notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of standing flood waters and flood affected land over the districts of Satkhira, Khulna, and Jessore, in Khulna Division, Bangladesh, extracted from MODIS Terra data acquired on 11 October 2013. MODIS Aqua data acquired on 21 October 2012 and MODIS Terra data acquired on 10 October 2011 was also analyzed to allow comparison with seasonal flooding seen in 2011 and 2012. Standing waters seen on the 11 October 2013 appear to cover a slightly larger area than standing water seen on 11 October 2011 and the 21 October 2012. However it is unknown whether the water detected in these images was increasing, peaking, or receding. Water detected in the 2011 and 2012 image may show the waters as they were receding. Both the 2011 and 2013 images were affected by clouds along the coast, to the north, and to the east of the area of interest. Notes: The exact limit of flood waters is uncertain because of the low spatial resolution of the satellite data used for this analysis. Only waters with an area of at least 250 square meters were likely detected in this analysis and thus many smaller water bodies were not visible. Detected water bodies therefore reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated in highly vegetated areas. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field.

Using satellite images acquired 21 June, 23 June & 7 July 2014, UNOSAT reviewed almost 4,500 square kilometers of Marcounda to locate signs of destroyed structures. An estimated 3,840 damaged structures are visible across 50 distinct locations in the sub-prefecture. Destruction in many cases was likely due to arson based on appearance of structural remains. In addition, it appears violence and destruction continued between 21 June and 7 July, and heavy rains apparently caused significant damage to structures as well. Overall, UNOSAT estimates that approximately 40% of structures in Marcounda Sub-Prefecture have been completely destroyed and many others are likely damaged to some degree.

Using a satellite image acquired 18 June 2014 and compared to an image from 12 January 2012, UNOSAT reviewed the town of Paoua and surrounding areas to locate obvious signs of destroyed structures (see inset for example). An estimated total of 323 destroyed structures were located in the area as well as 25 possible damage structures, both in Paoua and in outlying towns and villages. The destroyed structures comprise an estimated 2.2% of the total number of pre-conflict structures in Paoua.Most destruction detected in the 18 June image was most likely a result of burning given the blackened structural remains visible in the imagery.

      "notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected changes in agricultural areas of the Gaza Strip resulting from the July ? August 2014 conflict in the area. Using a satellite image collected 14 August 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT performed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index analysis, multitemporal classification, and manual review in order to detect significant changes occurring in agricultural areas between those dates. This methodology assessed damage occurring as a result of razing, heavy vehicle tracking, bombing, shelling, and related conflict dynamics. The analysis includes damage occurring to both active crop fields and fallow lands, as well as in many household gardens. Note that due to the special characteristics of the area analysed, razing might have been overestimated in sandy areas, and some ambiguity often exists between unused lands, pasture lands, agricultural fields, and other land cover types. UNOSAT analysis indicates that ~1,800 hectares of agricultural fields have likely been razed or heavily damaged by these factors in the intervening period. In addition, using imagery acquired on 27 and 28 August 2014 UNOSAT assessed damage to greenhouses and identified a total 657 destroyed, 214 severely damaged and 392 moderately damaged greenhouse structures. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT.",

Specifically, a total of 337 kilometers of roads in the city were likely mud affected as of 1 September, though this is likely an underestimate given the difficulties assessing road conditions in satellite imagery. In addition, 277 areas of standing water were identified, 19 areas indicated possible flash flood damage, and more than seven square kilometers of river banks, islands, and marshes were flooded.

The area surrounding Khartoum City and Umdurman was inundated by floods caused by heavy rains. Areas to the South of Umdurman seem to have been flooded and many other areas including Um Baba and Khartoum Bahri seem to be affected by varying levels of water and saturated soils. The flooded area over Khartoum has decreased slightly in some areas, however the higher resolution of the Pleiades shows more smaller standing bodies of water that were likely overlooked by previous sensors. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT",

Between 4 June 2013 and 21 July 2013 the number of shelters has thus increased by about 298 since the previous UNITAR/UNOSAT assessment. This indicates an approximate 3% increase in the number of shelters between 4 June and 21 July 2013. Domiz refugee camp is encircled by a fence that surrounds the perimeter of the camp and delineates the 148.12 hectares of the camp area. New expansion areas are also visible in the image as of 21 July 2013, indicating preparations are underway to accommodate increased numbers of refugees in the near future.

      "notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected water bodies at the Tokwe Mukorsi Dam, Masvingo Province, Zimbabwe, as detected by TerraSAR-X on 11 February 2014. The flooded area above the dam has greatly increased due to recent heavy rains and currently encompasses about 2,300 ha. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT.",
