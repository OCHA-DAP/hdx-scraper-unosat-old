# Scraper for UNOSAT Data
Scraper designed to extract data from [UNOSAT's website](http://www.unitar.org/unosat/maps). It contains a few routines for identifying datasets of interest and excluding possible duplicates. It generates a CKAN compliant metadata JSON with all the resources -- and gallery items -- that have to be created in batch on HDX.
